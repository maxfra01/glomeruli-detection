# Glomeruli Detection

## Project Outline

A correct identification and classification of glomeruli is of
paramount importance for the prognosis of the diabetic kidney disease [1]. This project aims at developing a ML pipeline able to:
1. Identify the glomeruli
2. Segment them
3. Separate different glomeruli classes in an unsupervised way. 

Since no ground truth is available in terms of glomeruli classification, we wish an unsupervised solution to see if any separability exists. Consider manifold learning methods to assess the separability of the different level of glomeruli necrotization (see below)
